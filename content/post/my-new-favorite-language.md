[Go](https://golang.org/) is quickly becoming my new favorite programming language.  It has many awesome features. One of my favorite is how easy it is to make a executable that I can transfer over to a machine and run it.  I'm not worrying about importing all the libraries onto the server.  Just run it.

One thing that drives me nuts sometimes is you can't have any unused variables or libraries. I know why and agree with it, but wow can it be annoying when testing code and setting things up.
